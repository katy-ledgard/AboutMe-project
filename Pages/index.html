                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Katy was born in the beautiful county of Norfolk, where she enjoys visiting the local beaches and broads. Her favourite beach is West Runton because it is full of rock pools, you can sometimes find fossils and its where they found the remains of a Woolly Mammoth!</p>
                <p>Her passions include Musical Theatre and Web Development. She is currently working on an 'About Me' webpage, featuring some made up content that she wishes were true! (She's not really talented enough to have been in shows or train at Bird College!)</p>
                <p>She is currently completing a Full Stack Bootcamp with Tech Educators.</p>
